# Scene Understanding for Autonomous Vehicles
The objective of this project is the evaluation of the most well-known methods in the object detection / recognition / classification using the most popular neural network techniques.  To do this, we analyse different neural networks and configuration to do the review some the best methods.

## Getting started
### Prerequistes
In order to follow the practicum guide, we installed needed tools and created a softlink to reference our dataset:
```
ln -s access_module /share/mastergpu
```
### Experiments 
After this, the main objective was the execution of the provided tools from the git repository to analyse results:

1.- First step before starting to run our script, it is understand how works:

```
$ train.py --help

usage: train.py [-h] [-c CONFIG_PATH] [-e EXP_NAME] [-s SHARED_PATH]
                [-l LOCAL_PATH]

Model training

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG_PATH, --config_path CONFIG_PATH
                        Configuration file
  -e EXP_NAME, --exp_name EXP_NAME
                        Name of the experiment
  -s SHARED_PATH, --shared_path SHARED_PATH
                        Path to shared data folder
  -l LOCAL_PATH, --local_path LOCAL_PATH
                        Path to local data folder
```

If we analyse the script. It is easy to test each required step in the practicum. 

- -c It specifies the modified configuration file (All the configuration files are modifications from `tt100k_classif.py` )
- -s It specifies the root folder from extract the necessary datasets for the experiments.
- -l It specifies the path for our workspace. It will have datasets and results from the executed experiments.
- -e It specifies the experiment name.

For our set of tests we apply create a softlink to easy the command line:
```
~$ ln -s /share/master access_modules
```
and we defined the workspace / local directory like `results`

After understanding this, each experiment is only change some parameters:


### Short explanation of the code in the repository

Most of the tasks were tested doing different configuration files and finally we write our networks ('InceptionV3' and 'Squeezenet') implementing the code. 

It was used different configuration filer for test and it was modified the necessary parameters:

- to apply resize (`tt100k_detection_resize.py`), we keep a (244,244) size:
```
resize_train                 = (224, 224)      # Resize the image during training (Height, Width) or None
resize_valid                 = (224, 224)      # Resize the image during validation
resize_test                  = (224, 224)      # Resize the image during testing
```
- to apply crop (`tt100k_detection_crop.py`), we enable flag for crop and disable flags for resize:
```
crop_size_train              = (64, 64)      # Crop size during training (Height, Width) or None
crop_size_valid              = (64, 64)      # Crop size during validation
crop_size_test               = (64, 64)      # Crop size during testing
resize_train                 = None            # Resize the image during training (Height, Width) or None
resize_valid                 = None            # Resize the image during validation
resize_test                  = None            # Resize the image during testing
```
- to apply the mean normalization with substract (`tt100k_detection_mean_substract.py`), we activate this type of mean and force to recompute:
``` 
norm_fit_dataset                   = True      # If True it recompute std and mean from images. Either it uses the std and mean set at the dataset config file
norm_featurewise_center            = True     # Substract mean - dataset
``` 
- to apply the fine-tuning (`tt100k_classif_belgium.py`), it was added a different dataset and enabled the flag to apply fine-tuning:
```
dataset_name                 = 'BelgiumTSC'	# Dataset name
....
..
model_name                   = 'vgg16'
....
..
load_pretrained              = True           # Load a pretrained model for doing finetuning
weights_file                 = '/.../exp_coen_carlos_a/weights.hdf5'  # Training weight file name

```

It was created two different neural networks InceptionV3 and Squeezenet. To do this, It was modified a few python classes from the provided code.
The code implements a factory pattern to load the different available models where `model_factory.py` includes the method which set up a network model. We will set up the networks which the provided structure data from `model.py` in the `inceptionV3.py` and `squeezenet.py` files. After this, it is update the `model_factory.py` with these new models.

- `inceptionV3.py` file uses the method from keras documentation [inception]. 
- `squeezenet.py` file is extracted from another repository [squeezenet] and it was adapted for keras 1.2

Finally, we created two configuration files (`tt100k_classif_inceptionV3.py` and `tt100k_classif_squeezenet.py` ) to add these lines:
```
model_name                   = 'InceptionV3'
```
```
model_name                   = 'squeezenet'
```


##### Run the provided code

- Analyse for crop and resize configuration: 
```
python train.py -c ./config/tt100k_classif_crop.py -l results -e experiment_crop -s ~/access_modules
python train.py -c ./config/tt100k_classif_resize.py -l results -e experiment_resize -s ~/access_modules
```

- Substract and mean configuration:
```cro
python train.py -c ./config/tt100k_classif_mean_substract.py -l results -e experiment_mean_substract -s ~/access_modules
```
 
- Fine tuning process:
```
python train.py -c ./config/tt100k_classif_belgium.py -l results -e experiment_fine_tuning -s ~/access_modules
```

##### Train a network on another dataset

TODO pending to finish!!


##### Implement a new network
For the practicum, It was implemented the InceptionV3 network. Keras has support for this neural network, It was easy to add this network to our code, which it is explained better in the  

In order to execute the new neural network, it is created a new configuration file and execute: 
```
python train.py -c ./config/tt100k_classif_inceptionV3.py -l results -e experiment_inception -s ~/access_modules
python train.py -c ./config/tt100k_classif_squeezenet.py -l results -e experiment_squeezenet -s ~/access_modules

```
